# ENSI_2024_ROBOCUP_LINEFOLLOWER
This code is for a line follower robot (ensi robocup 2024 map)
i want to thank hamma very much because without his assistance this code would never do what it did + i've learned from him more that what i've learned the past 2 years.
in this code you will find some functions that we did not use but we tried it and it works properly.
there is for example pid(normal version) and followlinebasic, these are some methodes to code a line follower robot.
if you need to understand anything about the code or if there is a comment that is not very clear please don't hesitate to contact me.
